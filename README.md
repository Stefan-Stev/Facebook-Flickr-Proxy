# Facebook

The project is part of Software engineer course. The team consisted of entire classroom students. It was developed an web application that serves as a proxy for interaction with multiple social networks. The interaction was accomplished through the public API of different social networks. My duty consisted of doing the bridge between our application and Facebook API. In the end, the user was able to post on facebook, to see the latest notifications from facebook, to give a like to certain posts, to post an video or an image on his facebook page. In addition to this, he could   make use of some statistics (e.g. the most frequent tag/ the most liked post). Php was the  programming language used.
